# MOIXA
## A high-performance, highly secure, and easy-to-use transparent proxy tool.
### What are its advantages?
> It uses a transparent proxy format. Compared to traditional proxy software models like fake-ip and reder-host, it supports multiple proxy methods, including DNS hijacking and MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks.
>
> Written in Go, it offers high performance, high speed, and concurrency support. It uses a toml configuration file format, eliminating YAML indentation hell.
>
> It also includes a built-in server and client. And 100% support IPV6 proxy in any env.
